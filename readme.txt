The Goal
Chaka Panda was commissioned by KlasseTV, during Project Agile Development (PAD).
The goal of the Chaka Panda project was to create a game for children between 4 and 6 years old.
This is why the game is rather easy, and tries to explain things visually, instead of textually.
The project duration was approximately 4 months (Feb - June 2014)

The Team
Our team consisted of:
Lukas Donkers		Lead Programmer, Scrum Master
Man-Git Liu		Lead Artist, Programmer
Dex van der Zwan	Document Manager, Sound Design
Vishal Chakawri		Menu Artist
Florian Kindt		Sound Design

The Implementation
We decided to create the game in Processing (Java) because that was where all teammembers had the most experience.
As prescribed by the PAD project manual, we used the Scrum methodology during the project.
Some files were supplied by the project manager: Music.pde and ParticleSystem.pde, which handle music and particles respectively.
We used an in-house version of Git to manage version control.

Post-deadline work
After the deadline of PAD (9th of June, 2014), I (Lukas Donkers) continued work on Chaka Panda solely to apply newly acquired knowledge.
This is why I moved the project to GitHub, and why I still commit new versions occasionally.
Since the deadline, I've added: this readme, GameState class, ContentHandler class, all comments (including TODOs), refactorisation
